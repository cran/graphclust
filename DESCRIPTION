Title: Hierarchical Graph Clustering for a Collection of Networks
Version: 1.3
Author: Tabea Rebafka [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Tabea Rebafka <tabea.rebafka@sorbonne-universite.fr>
Description: Graph clustering using an agglomerative algorithm to maximize the
  integrated classification likelihood criterion and a mixture of stochastic
  block models. The method is described in the article "Model-based clustering 
  of multiple networks with a hierarchical algorithm" by 
  T. Rebafka (2022) <arXiv:2211.02314>.
